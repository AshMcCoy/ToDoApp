Forgot to create branch but I hadn't done anything yet besides delete what I thought was an extra folder in the templates folder (which i ended up putting back LOL) Went ahead and pushed it to master. Then created a branch  named ashley

updated task_list.html
created DetailView, CreateView, DeleteView, UpdateView, FormView
created more templates
created/completed login/registration with templates

*I noticed he had in the Task model "complete" and you put "status"- I do think status is better but that will need to be changed eventually to a charfield as a booleanfield would not make sense but we can update that when its necessary. I'll leave it for now. 

created another user in the admin panel so you could see different accounts to compare- login info listed above below the superuser login info; created another user sallysue to test registration- info up above as well

Left Off at 1:32:10 in the youtube video- at this point the login/registration is up and running, as well as view task detail, edit and delete functions.
